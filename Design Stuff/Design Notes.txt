Design Notes

- The design of the game should be built upon the original game
- We could have many different faces and hair styles
    - These could be randomized, or the player could be given an option to customize before play
- Each piece of hair (beard, nose, etc) should be created as sprite animation
    - Each frame should be 512Ã—512 (pixels)
    - The sprite animations should have a transparent background
- Global leaderboards should be implemented
    - Using google play services to make sure all usernames are unique
